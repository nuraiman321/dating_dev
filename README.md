4. bern
5. callum
6. cath
7. felipe
8. jian
9. jimmy
10. linda
11. matt

## step 1
pick a reasonable data type to store this list in your program

## step 2
dt prefer to use his "real" name misty rose. write code to replace dt in the list with misty rose

## step 3
loop through the list and print out each name one at a time each in a separate line in the console only if the name **does not start with n**. (the code should still work even if the list changes in size)
